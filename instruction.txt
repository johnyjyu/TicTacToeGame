java GameMain
Then, play the game. 
The status information will be shown on the terminal. 

2) A high-level description of your program design.
We adopt Object Oriented Design, and separate the functions of the game into the following different modules. 
GameMain.java is the main and starting class, which contains the entry point - main method. 
In AIPlayerMinimaxCutoff.java, we implemented the required heuristic eval function. 
In AIPlayerBetterHuristic.java, we implemented a better heuristic eval function
